Evidence from studies on women's empowerment suggests that when women have a larger role in decision-making on crop selection and adoption, household well-being improves. However , the relation between women’s empowerment and crop decision-making is seldomly investigated in the literature. We integrate women studies and economics methods to explore links between crop trait preferences and women’s empowerment among agricultural primary decision makers in Bangladesh. We use disaggregated survey data from the Bangladesh Integrated Household Survey, covering three waves in 2011, 2015 and 2018. Focusing on cereals and legumes, we compute the women’s empowerment in agriculture index (WEAI) in each survey round and we regress the index on primary decision makers’ first and second top – ranked crop attributes. We find links between trait preferences and women’s empowerment, the gender of the primary decision maker and the hours worked by women on cereal and legume plots. Higher levels of women empowerment at the district level are associated with a shift in top-ranked trait preferences: from agronomic traits to quality traits, with market demand gaining momentum. Findings are enforced with the increase of hours worked by women on the plots, while the sex of the primary decision maker seems to play a marginal role. The present study is the first to relate indices of women’s empowerment to considerations of trait preferences. Our results call for developing gender-informed breeding methods which prioritize intra-household as well as intra-community gender dynamics.
