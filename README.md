#### <ins> Abstract of the paper <ins>

Evidence from studies on women's empowerment suggests that when women have a larger role in decision-making on crop selection and adoption, household well-being improves. However, the relation between women’s empowerment and crop decision-making is seldom investigated in the literature. We explore links between crop trait preferences and women’s empowerment among agricultural primary decision makers in Bangladesh. We use disaggregated survey data from the Bangladesh Integrated Household Survey, covering three waves in 2011, 2015 and 2018. Focusing on cereal and legume growers, we compute the metrics of women’s empowerment in agriculture index (WEAI) in each survey round and we regress the empowerment gap metric on primary decision makers’ first and second top – ranked crop attributes. We find links between trait preferences and women’s empowerment, the gender of the primary decision maker and the hours worked by women on cereal and legume plots. Higher levels of women empowerment at the district level are associated with a shift in top-ranked trait preferences: from agronomic traits to quality traits, with market demand gaining momentum. Findings are reinforced with the increase of hours worked by women on the plots, while the sex of the primary decision maker seems to play a marginal role. This study is the first to relate indices of women’s empowerment to crop trait preferences, highlighting the importance of research relating gender equality and women’s empowerment, to crop breeding.

#### <ins> Key findings <ins>

- An increase in women’s empowerment at district level (GPI) is associated with significant shifts in trait preference choices for cereals and legumes
- Increased gender parity is positively associated with selection of quality traits as a top trait of choice
- Closing of the empowerment gap correlates strongly and positively with the probability of decision makers to prefer market demand over yield
